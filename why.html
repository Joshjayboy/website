        <p>How do you choose your primary care doctor?&nbsp; Referral by friends or picked off an insurance list.&nbsp; Some young adults may not really care who they see - as long as they get their &ldquo;annual exam&rdquo; and have someone write for an antibiotic when they get sick. Others with chronic health conditions visit their doctor to refill their multiple medications which help control their disease&nbsp;<em>symptoms.</em></p>

        <p>But is this enough? Could this interaction between your doctor be far more beneficial in helping you&nbsp;<em>maximize your health&nbsp;</em>instead of just mitigating a disease process?</p>
        
        <p>How much does your doctor&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;know about you and your true health status?&nbsp;&nbsp; What can the typical 15-minute visit accomplish in answering your health questions or addressing your ongoing medical concerns?&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Is there an alternative, more comprehensive approach that aims to prevent future health conditions as well as determine the underlying cause(s) of your recurrent problems?</p>
        
        <p>YES! It&rsquo;s called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/functional-medicine.html" rel=" noopener">Functional Medicine&nbsp;</a>and here are 5 reasons why you should schedule this type of visit today.</p>
        
        <h1>5 Reasons for Holistic Primary Care with Functional Medicine</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Time spent with your doctor.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The average initial visit with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/functional-medicine.html" rel=" noopener">functional medicine doctor</a>&nbsp;can range from&nbsp;<strong>45 to 90 minutes</strong>.&nbsp; This gives you the opportunity to relax during your visit and tell your whole story:&nbsp; a chronologic timeline starting with information from your&nbsp;<em>in utero experience</em>&nbsp;all the way up until the present moment and everything in between.&nbsp; Like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces are put together to begin to understand your current condition.&nbsp; This valuable information also informs the doctor of what further testing might be necessary to help complete the puzzle.</p>
        
        <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>A true&nbsp;</strong><strong>preventive care approach</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The conventional adult annual exam usually consists of a set of basic labs, a physical exam, mammogram, colonoscopy and an EKG.&nbsp; When all checks out, patients walk away feeling that they are healthy because their doctor said that everything was &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.&nbsp; But is this accurate?&nbsp; Do your labs really reveal&nbsp;<strong><em>optimal wellness</em></strong>&nbsp;or just absence from disease?</p>
        
        <p>With a functional medicine approach, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/holistic-primary-care.html" rel=" noopener">holistic primary care&nbsp;</a>exam assesses&nbsp;<em>prevention</em>&nbsp;with much more rigor.&nbsp; It seeks to answer questions like:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>What is your current nutritional status,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/metabolic-therapy-thyroid-adrenal-hormone-correction.html" rel=" noopener">hormone health</a>, and microbiome makeup?</em></li>
            <li><em>What is your&nbsp;<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/4-lab-tests-to-assess-your-true-cardiovascular-risk" rel=" noopener">actual cardiovascular risk,</a>&nbsp;beyond what is determined with the basic lipid panel?</em></li>
            <li><em>What are some explanations behind your gradual&nbsp;<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/why-is-it-so-hard-to-lose-weight" rel=" noopener">weight gain</a>?</em></li>
            <li><em>Where are you on the diabetes continuum as opposed to do you have it or not?</em></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The answers to these types of questions help determine your &ldquo;true health&rdquo; and are necessary as you and your functional medicine doctor work to create a comprehensive treatment plan aimed at preventing future diseases.</p>
        
        <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>A&nbsp;</strong><strong>deeper dive into the root cause(s)</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>It is not enough to just treat the symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>It&rsquo;s important to understand the WHY behind the condition</strong>.&nbsp; For instance, if someone presents with symptoms of depression or fatigue, the conventional doctor may simply encourage more rest and better management of stress.&nbsp; A prescription anti-depressant could also be written.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In contrast, the functional medicine doctor starts by asking, why do you have these symptoms to begin with.&nbsp; Could this be from a hormonal imbalance, nutritional deficiency, or gut problem?&nbsp; Could your fatigue be due to an autoimmune process, food sensitivity, or other inflammatory process?&nbsp; This deeper dive lends itself to a more comprehensive view of one&rsquo;s overall health and the many&nbsp;<em>upstream factors</em>&nbsp;that can lead to the downstream presentation of the depression or fatigue.</p>
        
        <ol start="4">
            <li><strong>Taken&nbsp;</strong><strong>off drugs</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Many patients remain on drugs unnecessarily.&nbsp; By working with a functional medicine doctor for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/holistic-primary-care.html" rel=" noopener">holistic primary care</a>&nbsp;and getting to the root cause(s) of the illness, patients often no longer need medications (which mostly treat the symptoms).&nbsp; As most chronic diseases are lifestyle driven, medications can usually be weaned down or removed completely once the root cause is addressed.&nbsp; The band-aid of pharmaceuticals are therefore no longer needed.</p>
        
        <p>The knee-jerk reaction to treat with medications first is not a common practice in functional medicine.&nbsp; Instead, the focus is on diet and lifestyle changes along with the temporary use of supplements to support the body as it begins to heal.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <ol start="5">
            <li><strong>Partnership with your doctor: the 80/20 rule</strong></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Your future health is only about 20% dependent on what your doctor can do for you: asking the right questions, ordering the right tests, educating you on the medical condition and then providing treatment options.</p>
        
        <p>The other 80% is determined by what you DO when you leave the doctor&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; The patient plays an essential role in their own health outcomes and it&rsquo;s a trusting relationship with the doctor that facilitates this.&nbsp; Time spent getting to know the patient, hearing their stories, and educating them on their condition, ultimately leads to a treatment plan that both parties can agree on. This makes for a productive partnership in the care of the patient.</p>
