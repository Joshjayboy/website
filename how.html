<h3>Steps to Protect Yourself from EMFs and Electrosmog</h3>

<p>Many people who engage in various&nbsp;mindfulness-based healing &nbsp;methods find that electrosmog and radiation sickness makes practice exceedingly difficult, since it causes brain irritability which keeps our minds locked into perpetual fight/flight agitation. Children and older folks are more vulnerable. Listed here are some simple measures you can take to lessen electrosmog injury in your environment. Exposure to electrosmog is like any radiation; it is cumulative and small doses can add up to a large dose.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>EMF remediators (&nbsp; https://directory.emf-experts.com/ &nbsp;) can be hired to assess your office, home and living area. Two expert remediators in the Washington, D.C. area are:</p>

	<p>Elaine Hunolt 520-820-2285.&nbsp; www.healthyspacesIQ.com </p>

	<p>Chris Buonocore &ndash; 202-309-4084&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; www.thelifesourcesolution.com </p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>During sleep or when practicing mindfulness or any spiritual practice like yoga, turn the electricity off in the fuse box. You can turn off the electricity in the whole house or in a particular area like the bedroom, remembering that the electric currents in the rooms adjacent to a room (basement, room next door etc.) could be polluting the living space you are trying to isolate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you have a &ldquo;smart meter&rdquo; which broadcasts your electrical usage to the electric company, get rid of it. These electrical signals are potentially dangerous. Have the representative from the electric company read your meter once a month, the old-fashioned way. That may cost a little more but it is probably worth it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Any electrical device which is not mobile should be directly wired. Your computer should&nbsp;<strong><em>not&nbsp;</em></strong>be connected to your modem by WiFi.[1] &nbsp;Instead, buy an ethernet cable and connect your computer directly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The same goes for a landline telephone; connect it directly to the modem with a long telephone wire. Buy a phone with a handset wired to the cradle. Do not use portable phones. Get rid of all WiFi. If you use your cellphone exclusively, get a landline that is wired and keep your cellphone at a distance away from you.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All other computer related devices, printers, screens etc. should be hard-wired, not WiFi connected.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cellphones are portable and require a signal, but alleviating measures can be taken. Never put them on your head and instead, use the speaker device kept preferably at least two feet away from you. If you use an earbud, never use a WiFi connection to your phone or an electrical cable that puts a field directly in your ear. Instead use a GIA device (https://www.giawellness.com/2/products/energy/home/mobile-airtube-headset/) that converts the electrical signal from your phone into an acoustic signal (good ol&rsquo; sound waves) and these are delivered to your ear. Little devices can be stuck on your phone to supposedly lessen the dirty electricity. Do not &ldquo;wear&rdquo; cellphones unless it&rsquo;s simply necessary and keep them away from vital organs like shirt pockets. In a car or work environment, take them out of pockets and put them on seat or table next to you and away from everyone.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Q Link manufactures pendants that can be worn like a necklace which lessens the electrosmog in a 2-foot radius area, covering your head and vital organs&nbsp;https://www.shopqlink.com/collections/q-link-srt-3-pendant-collection &nbsp;). I have worn one for 40 years and I also fit one my dog.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A Q Link Nimbus can be plugged into the USB port of your computer or your car. (https://www.shopqlink.com/products/q-link-nimbus-with-srt-3-pink &nbsp;). They are advertised to form an omnidirectional 30-foot protective sphere of electrosmog protection, but when we kinesiologically tested them, they only worked out to a 10-12 foot distance, which is still excellent. I connect one to my computer and another one in my car.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you use a microwave, after you turn it on, get yourself, family members and your pets at least 10 feet away. Microwaves are horrific.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can buy a Trimeter device (&nbsp;https://www.trifield.com/product/trifield-emf-meter/ &nbsp;) and find other hotspots around your living area, like a microwave.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When 5G comes, do not use it. Do not let towers be placed anywhere near you living environment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Some of my patients use &ldquo;grounding&rdquo; to connect their body directly to the earth, such as simply standing with bare feet on the wet ground, to discharge or gather electrons and neutralize accumulated electrosmog. I am not sure how well this works, but it makes sense. If the ground in your electrical circuits work, you can use that to ground your body. However, there are contaminated electrical circuits underground especially in urban areas that might do more harm than good. The beach and a forest are better areas to ground your feet in. Remediators can assist in this area as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Most medications increase oxidative stress as they are often oxidized or &ldquo;burned&rdquo; in the process of detoxification, therefore the greater the use of medication the more susceptible one becomes to radiation sickness.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>On the other hand, most antioxidants, especially melatonin, provide some protective effects against radiation sickness and electrosmog.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Evidence is amassing that electrosmog should no longer be classified as a &ldquo;possible&rdquo; carcinogen and it should not even be upregulated to a &ldquo;probable&rdquo; cause of cancer. Electrosmog is a definite carcinogen and everyone needs to take measures to limit exposure for ourselves, our loved ones and our pets. Anyone suffering from these problems listed should take measures to remediate their exposures immediately as you may be running out of time. Those who have significant heavy metal or high iron levels may be more vulnerable to dirty electricity as the toxic metals conduct electricity. Test for toxic metals and detoxify them. Electrosmog adds sympathetic fight/flight stress to our nervous system, which is already riled up with all the psycho-emotional, immune, toxic, and other stress that comes with living in the modern world.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/webinars-events/webinar-mindfulness-and-healing-when-we-need-it-the-most.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mindfulness training</a>&nbsp;can alleviate some of this. There are other measures that can be taken besides those noted here, and many books have been written on this subject. MDs and other clinicians can get CME credits for training courses on electrosmog mitigation, which should be a part of treatment provided by all clinicians in primary care.
