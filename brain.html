        <p>The human brain, our beautifully designed master control center, is under attack from many modern environmental issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alarmingly, we&#39;re seeing increased cognitive impairment from young to old - Autism to Alzheimer&#39;s, anxiety, depression, neuro-degenerative diseases (Parkinson&#39;s, ALS) brain fog, stroke, memory and neurological issues.&nbsp; Although some of the increase is due to an aging population, we&#39;re seeing brain impairment at all age levels and the incidences are getting worse. &nbsp;Losing one&#39;s cognitive function is an ultimate fear and exploring the issue of prevention is the subject of this article.</p>

<p>Unlike our ancestors, we now must contend with the daily assault of Wi-Fi, chemicals and what I like to call the &quot;Dirty Dozen for the Brain.&quot;&nbsp; Modern technology has improved our lives in a myriad of ways, and we can&#39;t live in a bubble. But, to start, let&#39;s look at what may be affecting us daily and what we can do to avoid or at least minimize the Dirty Dozen- and keep our brains healthy.</p>

<h1>The Dirty Dozen for the Brain</h1>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Heavy metals</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Mercury, lead and aluminum found in air, fish, water, food, consumer products, dental fillings and more- toxic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/heavy-metal-detoxification-removal.html" rel=" noopener">heavy metals</a>&nbsp;can kill brain cells.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Toxic chemicals</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>200,000 chemicals are annually dumped into the environment including prescription drugs. Glyphosate (in Round-up) is an herbicide used on crops that has shown increased risk for some cancers, and able to affect the blood/brain barrier in humans and destroy neurotransmitters in studies with rats. Toxic chemicals kill brain cells.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Fluoride</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.nihadc.com/biological-dentistry/fluoride-information.html" rel=" noopener">Fluoride</a>&nbsp;is found in drinking water, the food chain, dental products, etc. and according to a government study, 23% of the U.S. population aged 6-49 is suffering from some degree of fluoride poisoning (fluorosis). Fluorosis can show on the teeth with stains, spotting and pitting. Fluoride can destroy the pineal gland in the brain and is a known enzyme disruptor. Click link for more&nbsp;<a href="https://files.iaomt.org/wp-content/uploads/IAOMT-Sources-of-Fluoride-Exposure-Chart.pdf" rel=" noopener">Sources of Fluoride</a>.</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>EMF&rsquo;s, Electromagnetic Frequencies</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Non-ionizing radiation from electricity, Wi-Fi, cell phones and more may destroy brain proteins and add stress to the brain. Read&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/are-you-sensitive-to-electrosmog-ways-to-minimize-exposure-to-emf" rel=" noopener">&quot;Are You Sensitive to Electro-Smog? Ways to Minimize Exposure.&quot;</a></p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>24/7 Stress</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The impact of modern life, demanding jobs, family life, poor sleep, and lights at night from electronics keep the body and brain in a constant state of stress i.e., sympathetic up-regulation rather than the &ldquo;rest and repair&rdquo; that is needed for healthy brains and bodies.</p>

<ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Poor Diet</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Poor quality and fast food do not nourish the brain! Sugar, contaminates, emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners and other chemicals feed the bad bugs and create a host of issues that affect brain health. &nbsp;Too much sugar can impair brain function, and type 2 diabetes ages the brain.</p>

<ol start="7">
	<li><strong>Allergies</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/allergy-testing-treatment.html" rel=" noopener">Food allergies, chemical allergies and other allergies</a>&nbsp;can contribute to chronic (brain) inflammation.</p>

<ol start="8">
	<li><strong>Head, jaw and sinus issues</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Dead teeth,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/biological-dentistry/cavitations-and-jawbone-infections.html" rel=" noopener">jawbone cavitations</a>, and infected sinuses may produce toxins and contribute to pain or chronic illness.</p>

<ol start="9">
	<li><strong>Structural issues in the neck, veins and cranium</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Chronic structural issues can cause pain and may even affect blood flow from the brain. Good&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/chiropractic-washington-dc-chiropractor.html" rel=" noopener">chiropractic care</a>&nbsp;can help correct these issues.</p>

<ol start="10">
	<li><strong>Dental Stress</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>An over-closed bite may create a cranial problem and hinder the glymphatic system (the brain does not drain).</p>

<ol start="11">
	<li><strong>Melatonin Deficiency</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Not producing enough melatonin due to too much light at night, stress, late nights, jet lag, caffeine, poor sleep habits, pineal gland toxicity (aluminum, glyphosate, fluoride and toxic chemicals, EMFs) &ndash; Melatonin is the brain #1 detoxifier and antioxidant agent.</p>

<ol start="12">
	<li><strong>Chronic Infections</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The bad bugs/infections/virus that may infest the brain such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/lyme-disease.html" rel=" noopener">Lyme Disease</a>, molds/fungi (notorious for brain fog problems), parasites and viruses (especially retroviruses) all may affect cognitive function and the ability to think clearly.</p>

<p>Once you understand what affects brain health, you can take positive steps to maintain a healthy brain. Note these are the same for your brain as for your body.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Healthy Brain</h2>

<p><strong>Remove the toxins from your life as much (and soon) as possible:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Eat organic, non-GMO food, and drink pure, clean water</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/heavy-metal-detoxification-removal.html" rel=" noopener">Detox heavy metals</a>, silver dental fillings and other dental remediation (dead teeth, cavitations)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Dental stress &ndash; get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/biological-dentistry/biological-dentistry.html" rel=" noopener">dental evaluation</a>&nbsp;for a TMJ/Cranial Mandibular structural problem that compromises your cranial rhythm and glymphatic system</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Clean up your EMF/electrosmog exposures (Dirty electricity, Wi-Fi, electronics)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Evaluate and treat the brain bugs</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Lyme Disease and co-infections</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Molds and other fungi</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Viruses &ndash; especially retrovirus and herpes family</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/bid/21846/Having-Gastrointestinal-Symptoms-Check-for-Parasites" rel=" noopener">Parasites</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Improve Your Sleep</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Consistent good quality sleep is key for rest and repair of the brain and body, the function of the glymphatic system, producing melatonin, mood, energy production and more.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-conditions/sleep-apnea.html" rel=" noopener">Sleep Assessment for Sleep Apnea</a>&nbsp;and improve sleep hygiene, and possible supplementation with melatonin.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Consider a Genetic and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/functional-medicine.html" rel=" noopener">Functional Medicine</a>&nbsp;assessment to understand the reasons for your issues and what you can do about them.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/genetic-testing.html" rel=" noopener">Genetic risk factors</a>&nbsp;combined with something in the environment (e.g. pesticides) can together start a disease process that affects the brain.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What is your toxic load that may be affecting your brain? How can you reduce it? Test, don&rsquo;t guess.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What genetic factors may play a role in how you detox, or why you suffer from insomnia?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Epigenetics are genomic abnormalities in the expression of the genes that may be modified with functional medicine.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>A knowledgeable&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/functional-medicine.html" rel=" noopener">Functional Medicine physician</a>&nbsp;looks at genetics and the environment of our modern world and the affect it has on the brain and body so that a personalized treatment plan can be developed to address the underlying cause of your health issues.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s be proactive in protecting the health of our brain.</strong></p>
