        <p>Many dietary fads come and go but intermittent fasting is here to stay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans have been using this eating technique for ages in virtually every major religion in the world for cleansing and purification purposes. &nbsp;The ancient Greek writer and historian, Plutarch, wrote, &ldquo;Instead of using medicine, better fast today.&rdquo; Unlike starvation, fasting is the&nbsp;<em>voluntary</em>&nbsp;withholding of food for health, spiritual or other reasons.</p>

<p>Today we know of the benefits of fasting beyond a cleanse. &nbsp;Fasting can improve insulin resistance and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/diabetes-integrative-medicine.html">diabetes</a>, lipid profiles,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/medical-weight-loss.html">weight loss</a>, brain function and cognition, as well as slow down the aging process.</p>

<p><strong>Who should NOT fast?</strong></p>

<p>Pregnant women, newborns and young children, those with prior eating disorders, type I diabetics (unless medially supervised), and severely underweight and malnourished individuals should not fast.</p>

<p><strong>Types of fasting:</strong></p>

<p>Researchers define fasting as the daily intake of less than 25% of ones total caloric needs.&nbsp; There is no exact way to fast.&nbsp; The following are options to consider.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You can decide to fast daily or every few days.&nbsp; Some people will do an extended 3-5 day fast monthly and maintain daily 16/8 fasts the rest of the month.&nbsp; Others may do a 24 hour fast during the work week and then eat 3 meals on the weekend. &nbsp;</p>

<p>During the feeding period, it is important not to restrict your calories.&nbsp; Remember, this is not a calorie based diet.&nbsp; Eat until you are comfortable.&nbsp; Of course, it is important that when you eat, you are focusing on high quality, non processed, non GMO, calorie dense foods with plenty of colorful vegetables.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation for fasting:</strong></p>

<p>Although everyone&rsquo;s health circumstances are different, here are some general recommendations to implement in preparation for your fast.&nbsp; If you are starting with an overnight simple fast, you can just go for it.&nbsp; Otherwise, consider:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Limiting your carbohydrate dense foods so you can help your body become&nbsp;<em>metabolically flexible</em>&nbsp;(the bodies preference for burning fat over glucose). This includes:</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>
	<ol>
		<li>Starches such as&nbsp;bread,&nbsp;cereal&nbsp;and&nbsp;pasta</li>
		<li>Milk,&nbsp;yogurt&nbsp;and&nbsp;ice cream</li>
		<li>Sweets,&nbsp;candy&nbsp;and soda</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Taking a high quality multivitamin/multi mineral supplement.</li>
	<li>Limiting your liquid calories making sure you have&nbsp;<em>herbal tea, bone broth, black coffee +/- MCT oil and filtered water</em>&nbsp;to be consumed during the fast.</li>
	<li>Lowering your overall stress.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tips for success during your fast:</strong></p>

<p>Remember to stay well&nbsp;<strong>hydrated</strong>&nbsp;with non caloric beverages (listed above).&nbsp; You can add Himalayan salt to your water or bone broth if you start to feel a little dizzy as your body may need the minerals.</p>

<p>Add&nbsp;<strong>Magnesium or Epson salt</strong>&nbsp;baths if you start to have muscle cramps or constipation.</p>

<p>If constipation develops, you can increase your fluid intake; add&nbsp;<strong>higher fiber meals</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>aloe vera</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>smooth move teas.</strong></p>

<p>The more you train your body to fast and become metabolically flexible the less hunger you will develop.&nbsp; In the beginning however, you may need to employ lifestyle strategies to deal with this sensation.&nbsp; Hunger comes in waves so try and ride it out by drinking more fluids and&nbsp;<strong>keeping your mind busy</strong>.&nbsp; The best time to begin your fast may be during a busy work day when you would not likely eat anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I hungry or just stressed and want to eat to cope?&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the answer is the latter, try&nbsp;<strong>deep breathing, aromatherapy, or mindfulness techniques</strong>.&nbsp; Better yet, go out and get some fresh air and do some grounding.&nbsp; These techniques can increase your &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormones to help you cope with the stress.</p>

<p>Try to&nbsp;<strong>avoid the kitchen,</strong>&nbsp;especially when you begin to fast.</p>

<p><strong>Eating around 6 pm</strong>&nbsp;will allow you to beat the rise in the hunger hormone, ghrelin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghrelin tends to spike in the evening so try and have a meal to suppress its production and thereby limit the desire for nighttime grazing.</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong>&nbsp;<strong>medium chain triglycerides (MCT) oil</strong>&nbsp;to your AM coffee which may create a more comfortable fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And finally, if you find yourself having difficulty during your fast,&nbsp;<strong>STOP the fast</strong>&nbsp;and eat something.&nbsp; Grab a handful of almonds or proceed with your meal.&nbsp; If you are doing an extended fast more than 3 days, break the fast gradually with broths and soups.&nbsp; After a few days, add low carb smoothies and light meals before incorporating your full meals again.</p>

<p>As fasting is a lifestyle, it is important to fit fasting into your life and not vice versa.&nbsp; Think about where and when it makes sense.&nbsp; There is no one way to fast.&nbsp; Make it work for you and enjoy the health benefits.&nbsp; And by the way, it&rsquo;s FREE!</p>
