        <p><strong>Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, was Right</strong></p>

<p>It is more important to understand the patient who has a disease, than it is to understand the disease that a patient has.&nbsp; ~ Hippocrates</p>

<p>Now that we are mostly through the first stages of the Corona or COVID-19 pandemic, we can appreciate that all the good preventative efforts (masks, social distancing, hand washing, disinfecting, etc.) have slowed the spread, giving our healthcare system &ldquo;breathing room&rdquo; to process new cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, as I have often explained, the media and governmental agencies tend to focus only on the virus and not on our&nbsp;<em>innate immunity,</em>&nbsp;which is our best defense system.&nbsp; However, having slowed the spread of COVID-19, it gives us all time to think about ways to enhance our immune systems, so I will reiterate here some information from my previous articles for two important reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It looks like COVID-19 will be with us for a long time, and while you may have escaped the first wave, it is a good idea to beef up your immunity now and for a long time to come. Don&rsquo;t drop your guard.&nbsp; Just remember the acronym, ABCD and&hellip;Z.&nbsp; Everything that you do to enhance your immune system also helps protect you from cancer and other chronic degenerative diseases.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507121353.htm" rel=" noopener">research on Vitamin D</a>&nbsp;from 10 countries shows (surprise, surprise) that deaths are much lower in those who have higher vitamin D levels.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to have your physician test your Vitamin D level, and keep it optimized.&nbsp; The ideal levels are greater than 50 ng/mL.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Supplements to Support the Immune System</strong></p>

<p>Please contact your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/practitioners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">integrative physician</a>&nbsp;or pediatrician for your correct dosage.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Vitamins (A, B, C, D)</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Minerals</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Optizinc&trade;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Copper chelate</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If you can find homeopathics such as&nbsp;<strong><em>Vir<u>us</u>&nbsp;Combination&nbsp;</em></strong>or herbals such as<strong><em>&nbsp;Vir<u>al</u>&nbsp;Combination</em></strong>&nbsp;(available at NuPathways,&nbsp;<a href="about:blank">www.nupathways.com</a>, 800-614-7714<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/virus-prevention#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>) and many outlets, add those to the mix.</p>

<p><strong>Lifestyle Tips to Build Immunity</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Immunosuppressant Medications</strong></p>

<p>If you are taking immunosuppressant medication such as prednisone on a regular basis, often prescribed for autoimmune disorders, check with your doctor to be certain that you are on as low a dose as possible so that your immunity is not suppressed.&nbsp; Try to manage symptoms instead with pain medication, anti-inflammatory herbals like turmeric and other supportive care like acupuncture. If you are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, have HIV or suffer from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/lyme-disease.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lyme Disease</a>, or have any condition that adversely affects your immune system, take the information presented here seriously and maintain sensible precautions.</p>

<p><strong>2. Address Inflammation&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Find the root causes of inflammation, such as food allergies.&nbsp; Knock off wheat and milk products, and eggs, which often are at the top of the list of pro-inflammatory foods.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nihadc.com/health-programs/allergy-testing-treatment.html" rel=" noopener">Food allergy testing</a>&nbsp;is available at NIHA and often covered by insurance plans.</p>

<p><strong>3. Keep Your Gut Healthy</strong></p>

<p>Handle GI inflammation so that your immune system, 70% of which may surround your intestines, is not wasting its precious resources with an unfriendly microbiome bug, such as fungal, bacterial or parasitic micro-organism.&nbsp; Take probiotics and digestive enzymes to help your intestines function better and avoid junk food and processed carbohydrates.&nbsp; You probably already know what sets your bowels off, so now is a good time to clean up your diet.&nbsp; This is covered in more detail in the article&nbsp;<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/healing-the-gastrointestinal-tract" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Healing the Gastrointesinal Tract to Boost Immunity.</a></p>

<p><strong>4. Address Chronic Infections</strong></p>

<p>If you have chronic Lyme Disease and/or co-infections, take your prescribed medications and remedies (e.g., homeopathics, anti-Lyme herbals, etc.) to help keep Lyme and any co-infections quarantined, which frees your immune system to be on the lookout for other invaders, such as COVID-19.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. Stay Hydrated</strong></p>

<p>Drink lots of filtered water and get enough rest, all of which helps to detoxify your immune system and rests it to be prepared to go into over-drive should COVID-19 show up.</p>

<p><strong>6. Stress Management</strong></p>

<p>Meditation, yoga, prayer and contemplation all settle down your autonomic, stressed-out immune system, so that it can be more vigilant.&nbsp; Stress of any kind, allergic, endocrine, toxic or psycho-emotional, are all immunosuppressive.&nbsp; Now is a good time to engage in &ldquo;spirituality&rdquo; practices that resonate with you.</p>

<p><strong>7. Get Outside Daily for Fresh Air</strong></p>

<p>Fresh air and sunshine help. Take a daily walk and enjoy the sun and fresh air. It clears the mind. Sunshine on the skin activates vitamin D. Oxygen helps kill virus and most micro-organisms, which is why high dose intravenous vitamin C seems to work (turns into hydrogen peroxide).&nbsp; Studies suggest that hydrogen peroxide kills the COVID 19 virus effectively.<a href="https://info.nihadc.com/integrative-health-blog/virus-prevention#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; So buy 3% hydrogen peroxide spray bottle ($2-$3), and use it to spray your masks and mouth, lips and throat before going out and coming home. &nbsp;H2O2 can be used as a disinfectant on surfaces.&nbsp; Many people now know about this research and you may have to search around to find a store that still has supplies of hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p><strong>8. Stop Smoking or other Drugs. Now.</strong></p>

<p>I once had a colleague who somehow got his medical license and probably only knew about 200 English words.&nbsp; He used to say to smokers, &ldquo;Ah, you smoke, you die.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is much more the case now.&nbsp; If you smoke, stop.&nbsp; Use any method available, even one of my books, &ldquo;End Your Addiction Now&rdquo; or &ldquo;End Nicotine Addiction Now,&rdquo; which has the protocols of amino acids that may help you quit and will make it virtually harder to smoke.&nbsp; Marijuana, alcohol, other drugs?... Now&rsquo;s a good time to stop.&nbsp; Your immune system will appreciate sobriety.</p>

<p><strong>9. Take This Seriously</strong></p>

<p>If you are elderly and/or have underlying medical conditions that make you much more vulnerable to COVID-19 (like me), please take all of the measures above very seriously.</p>

<p><strong>10. HIV</strong></p>

<p>If you have HIV, take all of these measures above very seriously, and take your medications.</p>

<p><strong>Be Prepared</strong></p>

<p>We all sometimes take all the blessings of modern life for granted, and often fall into the trap of believing that we don&rsquo;t need to work to stay healthy. If I get sick, I will just take a drug to fix anything that goes wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>However, life is still fragile and precious, and we can do a lot to strengthen our immune systems.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>COVID-19 has woken us up to these facts and provided us all with a good dose of humility.&nbsp; In fact, the 2017-2018 influenza killed around 80,000 Americans, now COVIDS-19 has surpassed that, and so let&rsquo;s transform this global tragedy into a healthy respect for the ravages of mother nature and be better prepared for the next flu season and for any pandemic in the future.</p>
